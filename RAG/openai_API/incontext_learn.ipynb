A 23-year old male drove V3 and was not injured. He stated that he was stopped in traffic when he saw V1 in his rearview mirror driving very fast towards the vehicle in back of him. The driver of V3 turned his wheel to the right but was struck in the back by V2. V3 was driven away from the scene. No Critical Precrash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to V3 because it was not involved in the first harmful event. The driver of V3 was talking with his passenger at the time of the crash but had watched the crash unfold in his rear view mirror. It was not thought that the driver of V3 contributed to the crash.', metadata={'source': 'Cases.csv', 'row': 9})]"

The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.The content about some typical accident.: This near-side impact crash case involves a 31 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with deployed frontal, side impact and side curtain air bags who sustained moderate injuries. This crash occurred during evening hours in a four legged intersection with stop signs present for north/southbound traffic. These intersecting streets are both two lane, two way asphalt roadways with no curbs. In the area where the crash occurred, there is an uphill grade for southbound vehicles approaching the intersection, then the travel lane levels off. The intersecting roadway is comprised of one eastbound lane, one westbound lane and left turn only lanes present at the intersection. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2013 Subaru Forester compact utility vehicle, was traveling south in the southbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2012 Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle, was traveling west on the intersecting street. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of V1's frontal, left side impact and both side curtain air bags. V1 rotated clockwise as V2 rotated counterclockwise. The vehicles traveled in a southwesterly direction. V1 departed the southwest corner of the intersection and came to final rest facing southeast. V2 came to final rest near the same corner, facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 31 year old female driver of V1 who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's steering column mounted frontal, left seat back mounted and left and right roof side rail mounted curtain air bags all deployed during the crash. This case occupant sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital where she was hospitalized overnight. She was transferred to the trauma center the following day and was hospitalized for an additional two days. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. The driver and sole occupant of V2 was reported to have sustained visible injuries, but her treatment status is unknown.The content about some typical accident.: This crash occurred in the evening hours on the bituminous northbound lanes of a divided urban highway. The two northbound were dry, level, curved to the right, and featured shoulders on both sides as well as a posted speed limit of 80kmph (50mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was dark but lighted with normal traffic flow. V1, a 2000 Mazda 626, was traveling north in lane one when its left side was contacted by V2, an unknown type van, as it re-entered the roadway from the shoulder. The initial impact caused V1 to lose control of her vehicle and began to swerve off the road to the left. She drove a few feet up the embankment on the side of the road digging her left side tires into the grass/dirt causing them to blow out and damage her undercarriage. V1 abruptly steered right descended down the hill and began to rollover. V1 re-entered the roadway still turning clockwise and rolled over two quarter turns onto its top coming to final rest facing south. V2 continued traveling and didn't stop. V1 was driven a 25-year old female in good health on her way home. She stated she didn't expect a vehicle (V2) to be traveling on the shoulder. When she finally saw V2 encroaching from the left shoulder into her lane. Both driver and passenger were transported to the hospital with moderate injuries and V1 was towed due to damages. The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded other motor vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over left lane line. The only associated factor coded to this driver was fatigue; she said that she'd worked 12hrs that day (but claimed she wasn't tired). V1 was not thought to have contributed to this crash. V2 left the scene without stopped therefore no driver interview or vehicle inspection could be obtained. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as an unknown decision error. There are no known associated factors coded to this vehicle, as the driver wasn't interviewed.The content about some typical accident.: This crash occurred on a two-lane asphalt roadway. It was clear, dry weekend morning. The speed limit was 48 kmph (30mph) and there was a 2.8% uphill grade. Vehicle 1 was a 2004 Nissan Frontier driven by an 18 year-old female. Vehicle 1 was traveling east along a slight left curve that had a radius of 1125m. Vehicle 2 was an unoccupied 2005 Ford Crown Victoria that was legally parked at the right (south) curb heading east. The front of Vehicle 1 contacted the back of Vehicle 2. Both vehicles traveled 25m east before coming to rest at the right curb. The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle 1 was this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of travel lane. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was an internal distraction. The driver of Vehicle 1 told police that she was distracted by an insect inside the vehicle.\""

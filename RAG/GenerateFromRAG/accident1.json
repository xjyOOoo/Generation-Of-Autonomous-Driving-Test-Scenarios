The primary crash occurred during the early evening hours under clear, dry conditions on a two-lane rural highway with a posted speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph). The roadway was straight and wet due to recent rainfall. \n\n**Vehicles Involved:**\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** A 2010 Chevrolet Cruze, driven by a 28-year-old male, belted.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** A 2004 Honda Civic, driven by a 32-year-old female, belted.\n- **Vehicle 3 (V3):** A 2015 Ford Explorer, driven by a 45-year-old male, unbelted.\n\n**Occupants:**\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** The driver (28-year-old male), belted, and one child passenger (7-year-old male), belted.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** The driver (32-year-old female), belted, and one child passenger (5-year-old female), belted.\n- **Vehicle 3 (V3):** The driver (45-year-old male), unbelted.\n\n**Events:**\n1. **Event 1 (Primary Collision):** V1 was traveling northbound in the left lane and V2 was traveling southbound in the right lane. V2, failing to see V1, skidded for approximately 120 meters and struck the rear end of V1 at the rear plane (Event 1). The impact pushed V1 forward into the oncoming lane.\n2. **Event 2 (Collision with V3):** The forward momentum of V1 caused it to collide with the left front corner of V3 (Event 2). V3 continued into the intersection and came to a stop on the east shoulder.\n3. **Event 3 (Rotation of V1):** The force of the impact caused V1 to rotate 90 degrees to the left (counterclockwise) and come to rest in the intersection. V1 was pushed further into the oncoming lane where it collided with a light pole (Event 4).\n4. **Event 4 (Collision with Light Pole):** V1 struck a light pole, causing it to roll right for a quarter-turn and come to rest facing northeast in the intersection.\n5. **Event 5 (Rotation of V2):** V2, which had drifted into the oncoming lane, rotated clockwise after the initial impact and came to rest on the west shoulder.\n6. **Event 6 (Fire in V1):** A small fire started in the engine compartment of V1 post-collision due to fuel system damage (Event 7).\n\n**Injuries:**\n- **V1 (28-year-old male driver):** Sustained severe injuries and was transported to the hospital. His injuries included a broken leg, multiple fractures, and internal bleeding.\n- **Child Passenger (7-year-old male):** Sustained moderate injuries, including a broken arm and lacerations.\n- **V2 (32-year-old female driver):** Sustained moderate injuries, including a shoulder sprain and a concussion.\n- **Child Passenger (5-year-old female):** Sustained minor injuries, including a minor scrape and a bruise.\n- **V3 (45-year-old male driver):** Sustained severe injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of death was determined to be a combination of blunt force trauma and blood loss.\n\n**Witnesses:**\n- A pedestrian on the south side of the road witnessed the initial collision between V1 and V2 and reported it to the police.\n\n**Preventive Measures:**\n- Proper seat belt use by all occupants.\n- Enhanced visibility and reduced speed in wet conditions.\n- Increased awareness and caution when driving on rural roads during low visibility conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe multi-event crash was primarily due to V2 failing to maintain adequate distance from V1 and V3, leading to a series of subsequent collisions.

        "response": "### Accident Report\n\n**Type: Multiple Cars**\n\n**Description:**\n\nThis investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 35-year-old, male driver of a 2017 Toyota Camry, who sustained serious injuries in a multi-event crash involving three vehicles. The case vehicle was also occupied by an unbelted driver and a 12-year-old passenger using a child restraint. A 25-year-old female was driving the Camry. The 12-year-old passenger was seated in the front passenger seat, secured in a booster seat. Both occupants suffered police-reported incapacitating injuries. \n\nThe crash occurred during early evening hours in the rain, on a wet, two-lane, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 90 km/h (55 mph). The road was straight and had a minimal 1% crown. Visibility was poor due to the rainy conditions and dim street lighting. \n\nThe primary parties involved in the crash were:\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** A 2017 Toyota Camry, driven by the 35-year-old male.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** A 2010 Ford F-150 pickup, driven by a 30-year-old male.\n- **Vehicle 3 (V3):** A 2012 Honda Civic, driven by a 22-year-old female.\n\nVehicle 1 was traveling northbound in the right lane. Vehicle 2 was traveling southbound in the left lane. Vehicle 3 was traveling northbound in the right lane behind Vehicle 1, at a reduced speed due to the weather conditions.\n\nVehicle 2 did not have enough time to react to Vehicle 1's sudden stop due to the wet road conditions and was traveling at a higher speed. V2 skidded for approximately 80 meters before colliding with the rear of V1 (Event 1). The force of the impact caused V1 to push forward into the oncoming lane of travel, where its front end struck the left side of V3 (Event 2). The impact force from V3 then caused V1 to rotate clockwise approximately 90 degrees (Event 3), coming to rest in a partially overturned position on the right side of the road.\n\nSimultaneously, V2 was pushed forward and rotated 180 degrees, coming to rest in the left shoulder of the road (Event 4). V3, after being struck by V1, rotated to the left and came to rest in a similar position (Event 5). All three vehicles were towed from the scene due to significant damage.\n\nThe 35-year-old driver of V1 was wearing a seatbelt and had deployed side and frontal airbags. The unbelted driver of V2 and the 12-year-old passenger in V1 sustained police-reported incapacitating injuries. The 22-year-old driver of V3 sustained minor injuries.\n\n**Post-Crash Actions:**\n- V1 and V2 were towed to a nearby repair facility due to extensive damage.\n- V3 was able to be driven to a nearby repair facility.\n- Emergency medical services were dispatched, and the 35-year-old driver was taken to the hospital for treatment of serious injuries. The unbelted driver of V2 was also transported to the hospital with incapacitating injuries, while the 12-year-old passenger in V1 sustained serious injuries and was also taken to the hospital. The 22-year-old driver of V3 received treatment for minor injuries and was released on the scene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe accident was largely attributed to the poor weather conditions, lack of sufficient stopping distance, and the high speeds at which the vehicles were traveling. Enhanced visibility and slower speeds are recommended to prevent similar incidents."

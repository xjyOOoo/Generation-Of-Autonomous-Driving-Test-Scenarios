This two-vehicle collision occurred during the evening hours at the intersection of two urban trafficways. The north/south trafficway consists of two roadways divided by a raised concrete median. The southbound roadway consists of two southbound through lanes with a right turn lane (three lanes). The one-way westbound channelized roadway consists of two travel lanes for through traffic and one dedicated right turn lane at the intersection. Both roadways are straight, with a speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph), and the intersection is controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals.\n\nAt the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. Vehicle 1, a 2019 Toyota Corolla, was driven by the 34-year-old female driver (CIREN case subject) in the number three, southbound, travel lane approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of V1 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling south. Vehicle 2, a 2021 Ford F-150, was traveling westbound in the far left lane, approaching the intersection from the east. The driver of V2 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling west.\n\nBoth vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of V2 struck the left side plane of V1 (Event 1). Vehicle 1 yawed in a counterclockwise direction and impacted a concrete curb (Event 2) with its right rear wheel. This impact caused V1 to trip and undergo a right-side-leading four-quarter-turn rollover event (event 3). During the rollover event, V1 impacted a metal guardrail with its undercarriage (Event 4). Vehicle 1 came to rest on its top in the grassy area off the west edge of the roadway. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage.\n\nVehicle 2 rotated in a slight counterclockwise direction coming to rest off the west edge of the roadway. Vehicle 2 was towed due to disabling damage.\n\n**Injuries:**\nThe 34-year-old female driver of V1 was seriously injured and was transported to the nearest hospital. The driver of V2 was not injured and remained at the scene for an accident investigation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe collision was caused by the female driver of V2 failing to yield the right of way at the intersection, which resulted in a head-on collision with V1. The evidence from the crash, including witness statements and physical evidence from the vehicles, supports this conclusion.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Increase awareness among drivers about the importance of yielding the right of way at intersections.\n2. Review traffic signal timing and adjust as necessary to ensure safety.\n3.

This two-vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours of a sunny day at the intersection of two urban trafficways. The north/south trafficway consists of four travel lanes divided by a raised concrete median. The southbound roadway consists of two southbound through lanes and two dedicated right-turn lanes, while the northbound roadway consists of two northbound through lanes and two dedicated left-turn lanes. The one-way east/west trafficway consists of two travel lanes and is controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals. Both roadways are straight, with a speed limit of 88 km/h (55 mph), and the intersection is a four-way intersection with no pedestrian crosswalks.\n\nAt the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. Vehicle 1, a 2019 Toyota Camry sedan, was driven by the 42-year-old male driver (CIREN case subject) in the second southbound travel lane, approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of V1 intended to continue traveling south. Vehicle 2, a 2020 Ford F-150 pickup truck, was traveling westbound in the far left lane, approaching the intersection from the east. The driver of V2 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling west.\n\nBoth vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of V2 struck the left side plane of V1 (Event 1). Vehicle 1 yawed in a counterclockwise direction and impacted a concrete curb with its right rear wheel (Event 2). This impact caused V1 to trip and undergo a right-side-leading four-quarter-turn rollover event (Event 3). During the rollover event, V1 impacted a metal guardrail with its undercarriage (Event 4). Vehicle 1 came to rest on its top in the grassy area off the west edge of the roadway. Vehicle 1 was towed due to extensive damage.\n\nVehicle 2 rotated in a slight counterclockwise direction and came to rest off the west edge of the roadway. The driver of V2 sustained minor injuries and was transported to the hospital. Vehicle 2 was towed due to disabling damage.\n\n**Investigative Findings:**\n\n- **Traffic Signals:** Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and the signals were operational but did not activate in a way that would have helped prevent the collision.

This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours at the intersection of two urban trafficways. The north/south trafficway consists of two roadways divided by a raised concrete median. The southbound roadway is a two-lane road with one through lane and one dedicated right-turn lane. The one-way eastbound channelized roadway consists of two travel lanes for through traffic and one dedicated right turn lane at the intersection. Both roadways are straight, with a speed limit of 56 km/h (35 mph), and the intersection is controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals.\n\nAt the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. Vehicle 1, a 2019 Toyota Camry, was being driven by the 38-year-old male driver (CIREN case subject) in the number two, southbound, travel lane approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of V1 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling south.\n\nVehicle 2, a 2020 Honda Civic, was traveling eastbound in the far left lane, approaching the intersection from the east. The driver of V2 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling east. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of V2 struck the left side plane of V1 (Event 1). Vehicle 1 yawed in a counterclockwise direction and impacted a concrete curb (Event 2) with its right rear wheel. This impact caused V1 to trip and undergo a right-side-leading four-quarter-turn rollover event (event 3). During the rollover event, V1 impacted a metal guardrail with its undercarriage (Event 4). Vehicle 1 came to rest on its top in the grassy area off the west edge of the roadway. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage.\n\nVehicle 2 rotated in a slight counterclockwise direction and came to rest off the west edge of the roadway. Vehicle 2 was towed due to disabling damage.\n\n**Injuries:**\nThe 38-year-old male driver of Vehicle 1 sustained serious injuries and was transported to the hospital. No other passengers were in the vehicle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe accident was determined to be a result of both drivers failing to yield the right of way at the intersection. The eastbound driver of V2 was cited for running a red light. The northbound driver of V1 did not have a stop sign at that intersection but had a medical event that rendered him unconscious, causing the car to move forward and collide with V2.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1.

The three eastbound lanes of the eastern leg consisted of a merge lane from the intersecting road and two through-lanes. The roadway was straight with a speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph), and the intersection was controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry.\n\n**Vehicle and Driver Information:**\n\n- **Vehicle 1 (2016 Hyundai Elantra):**\n  - Driver: 32-year-old male, unbelted\n  - Location: Left through-lane of the westbound travel lanes\n  - Intent: To cross through the intersection and continue traveling west\n\n- **Vehicle 2 (2019 Ford F-150):**\n  - Driver: 45-year-old male, belted\n  - Location: Left through-lane of the eastbound lanes\n  - Intent: To wait for the traffic signal to turn green and cross through the intersection and continue traveling west\n\n**Sequence of Events:**\n\n- **Event 1:** Vehicle 1 approached the intersection from the east. The driver of Vehicle 1 did not notice the vehicles stopped ahead at the traffic light. The traffic signal turned green, and Vehicle 2 began to slowly move forward.\n- **Event 2:** The frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck the rear plane of Vehicle 2. The impact caused both vehicles to come to rest in the left through-lane of the westbound lane, facing in a westerly direction.\n- **Event 3:** Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. Vehicle 2 was not towed nor disabled.\n\n**Injuries:**\n\n- **Driver of Vehicle 1:** Sustained serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis and lacerations to the face. The driver was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe crash was primarily caused by the failure of the driver of Vehicle 1 to notice the stopped vehicles ahead, leading to the collision. Both vehicles were equipped with standard safety features, but the lack of seatbelt use by the driver of Vehicle 1 significantly contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Enhance driver awareness through traffic education campaigns.\n- Increase the use of seatbelts among drivers and passengers.\n- Improve visibility at intersections by ensuring that traffic signals are well-maintained and clearly visible."

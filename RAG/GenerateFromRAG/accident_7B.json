Vehicle 1 sustained significant damage as a result of the impact.\n\nThe crash occurred during the early morning hours (dark, street lights present) on a weekday, at the intersection of two urban roadways. The north/south roadway consisted of four northbound lanes and two southbound lanes, with the speed limit set at 89 kmph (55 mph). The intersection was controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals. \n\nVehicle 1 was being driven by the 42-year-old male driver in the far-left southbound lane, approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling south through the intersection. \n\nVehicle 2, a 2019 Toyota Camry, was stopped in the far-left southbound lane of the northbound travel lanes, behind other vehicles, waiting for the traffic signal to turn green. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to proceed south through the intersection.\n\nAs the traffic signal turned green, Vehicle 1 began to accelerate through the intersection, while Vehicle 2 was still stopped. Vehicle 1 collided with the front plane of Vehicle 2 (Event 1). Both vehicles came to rest facing south, with Vehicle 1 in the far-left lane and Vehicle 2 directly behind it in the lane. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to significant damage sustained in the crash. Vehicle 2 was not towed but was disabled.\n\n**Injury Details:**\n- The 42-year-old male driver of Vehicle 1 sustained multiple injuries including a fracture to his left femur, lacerations to his arms and legs, and a concussion. He was transported to the hospital for further treatment.\n\n**Weather and Road Conditions:**\n- The weather was clear, and the road surface was dry at the time of the crash.\n\n**Traffic Signals and Roadway Layout:**\n- The intersection was well-lit and had overhead traffic signals. The signals were functioning correctly, and the timing of the green light for southbound traffic allowed Vehicle 1 to proceed.\n\n**Other Relevant Information:**\n- Vehicle 1 was not equipped with any airbags as it is a subcompact utility wagon. Vehicle 2 was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and passengers.\n\n- The crash reconstruction indicated that Vehicle 1 was traveling at approximately 70 kmph (43 mph) when it entered the intersection.

The primary event in this crash involved a collision between the frontal plane of the case vehicle and the frontal plane of a 2010 Honda Accord sedan. Prior to this collision, the case vehicle sustained a far-side sideswipe collision with a 2008 Toyota Corolla.\n\nThe four-vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours (dark, street lights present) on a multi-lane suburban highway. This trafficway is composed of asphalt and has five lanes that primarily travel in an east and west direction. The eastbound lanes have a slight positive grade and three travel lanes. The westbound roadway has two travel lanes. The roadway is straight with no traffic control devices. There is a posted speed limit of 120 km/h (75 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry.\n\n**Vehicles Involved:**\n\n- **Vehicle 1 (Case Vehicle):** 2018 Toyota Camry sedan, driven by a 43-year-old male (CIREN case subject). The driver was wearing a seatbelt.\n- **Vehicle 2:** 2008 Toyota Corolla, driven by an unknown age male. The vehicle was traveling in the number one, eastbound travel lane.\n- **Vehicle 3:** 2010 Honda Accord, driven by a 28-year-old female, was traveling in the number three eastbound travel lane.\n- **Vehicle 4:** 2012 Nissan Sentra, driven by a 32-year-old female, was traveling in the number four travel lane.\n\n**Sequence of Events:**\n\n1. **Event 1:** Vehicle 2 drifted to the right and entered the south edge of the right shoulder, where its right side impacted the left side of Vehicle 3 (Event 1). This impact redirected Vehicle 2 back onto the roadway, where its left side struck the right side of Vehicle 1 (Events 2 and 3).\n   \n2. **Event 2 & 3:** The impact caused Vehicle 1 to enter into a counterclockwise rotation. Vehicle 1 exited lane two, crossed lane three, and entered the number four travel lane where the frontal plane of Vehicle 4 impacted the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 (Event 4).\n\n3. **Event 4:** The impact caused Vehicle 1 to rotate further in a counterclockwise direction where it struck a large pothole, causing the vehicle to go off the roadway and come to rest facing northeast in a grassy median area. Vehicle 1 also had a small fire contained to the engine compartment (Event 7).\n\n4. **Event 5 & 6:** Vehicle 4, after the initial impact, continued to rotate in a counterclockwise direction and impacted a Jersey barrier with the frontal plane (Event 6). Vehicle 4 then came to rest facing in a northeasterly direction on the north shoulder of the highway.\n\n5. **Event 7:** Vehicle 1 rotated a short distance in a clockwise direction due to the impact forces and came to rest facing northeast in the number three, eastbound travel lane.\n\n6. **Event 8:** Vehicle 2, after the initial impact, continued to rotate in a clockwise direction for a short distance and came to rest facing northeast in the number three, eastbound travel lane.\n\n**Post-Collision Events:**\n\n- All vehicles involved were towed from the scene due to disabling damage.\n- Vehicle 1 also had a small fire contained to the engine compartment.\n\n**Injuries:**\n\n- The 43-year-old male driver of Vehicle 1 sustained serious injuries.\n- The 28-year-old female driver of Vehicle 3 was uninjured.\n- The 32-year-old female driver of Vehicle 4 sustained minor injuries.\n- The occupants of Vehicle 2 were not identifiable, and their status was unknown at the time of the report.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe primary cause of the collision was the drifting of Vehicle 2 onto the shoulder, which resulted in a series of sequential impacts. The lack of reaction time and proper lane control by the drivers of Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 1 contributed significantly to the severity of the crash. All drivers were advised to exercise caution and maintain proper lane position and speed to avoid similar accidents in the future.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Increase awareness and education on proper lane usage and maintaining safe following distances.\n2. Encourage the use of vehicle sensors and lane departure warning systems.\n3. Implement speed management strategies to ensure compliance with posted speed limits.\n\nThis report is provided for further investigation and to support any necessary legal proceedings."

This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours at the intersection of two urban trafficways. The north/south trafficway consists of two roadways divided by a raised concrete median. The southbound roadway consisted of two southbound through lanes with a right turn lane (three lanes). The one-way eastbound channelized roadway consists of two travel lanes for through traffic and one dedicated right turn lane at the intersection. Both roadways are straight, with a speed limit of 60 km/h (37 mph), and the intersection is controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry.\n\nVehicle 1, a 2018 Toyota Camry sedan, was driven by the 45-year-old male driver (CIREN case subject) in the number three, southbound, travel lane approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of V1 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling south. Vehicle 2, a 2018 Honda Civic compact car, was traveling eastbound in the far left lane, approaching the intersection from the east. The driver of V2 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling east.\n\nBoth vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of V2 struck the left side plane of V1 (Event 1). Vehicle 1 yawed in a counterclockwise direction and impacted a concrete curb (Event 2) with its right rear wheel. This impact caused V1 to trip and undergo a right-side-leading five-quarter-turn rollover event (Event 3). During the rollover event, V1 impacted a metal guardrail with its undercarriage (Event 4). Vehicle 1 came to rest on its top in the grassy area off the east edge of the roadway. Vehicle 1 was towed due to extensive damage.\n\nVehicle 2 rotated in a slight counterclockwise direction and came to rest straddling the intersection, facing in a southeast direction. Vehicle 2 was towed due to disabling damage. Both drivers were taken to the hospital for medical treatment.\n\n#### Contributing Factors:\n1. **Driver Error:** The driver of V2 was likely traveling at an excessive speed or not giving way to V1 at the intersection, leading to the collision.\n2. **Intersection Design:** The lack of a stop sign or reduced speed signage at the intersection contributed to the high speed of vehicles entering the intersection.\n3. **Visibility:** Clear weather conditions and dry road surfaces allowed for higher speeds but did not mitigate the collision risk.\n\n#### Recommended Safety Improvements:\n1. **Traffic Signal Timing:** Adjust traffic signal timing to ensure adequate green light duration for vehicles approaching the intersection.\n2. **Rear-End Collision Prevention Systems:** Install collision avoidance systems in vehicles to reduce the risk of rear-end collisions.\n3. **Traffic Signage:** Place more visible and larger warning signs at the intersection to alert drivers to the potential for conflicts.\n4. **Driver Education:** Conduct public education campaigns to emphasize the importance of obeying traffic signals and the dangers of excessive speed at intersections.\n\nThis report will be forwarded to the relevant traffic safety agencies for further investigation and implementation of safety improvements."

The collision resulted in significant damage to both vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to the occupants of the Toyota Camry. The crash occurred during late afternoon hours (dark, street lights present) on a fall weekday at the intersection of two urban roadways in a suburban area.\n\nThe intersection in question features an east-west arterial road with two eastbound lanes and two westbound lanes, and a north-south residential street with two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. The arterial road had a straight segment with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph), while the residential street was also straight with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The intersection was controlled by standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals, and street lighting was adequate for visibility during the crash.\n\nAt the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2014 Toyota Camry sedan, was traveling eastbound in the left eastbound travel lane of the arterial road and was in the process of attempting to make a right turn onto the residential street. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to make the turn as soon as the northbound residential street traffic light turned green.\n\nVehicle 2, the 2017 Ford Escape, was traveling westbound in the right westbound travel lane of the arterial road and was proceeding to cross the intersection to continue traveling westbound on the arterial road. The driver of Vehicle 2 was stopped at the traffic signal in the right westbound travel lane, waiting to proceed through the intersection.\n\nThe traffic signal turned green for eastbound traffic on the arterial road. The driver of Vehicle 1, despite the green light, failed to properly assess the intersection and did not see the Ford Escape stopped in front of him. As a result, the rear plane of Vehicle 1 struck the front plane of Vehicle 2 (Event 1).

This two-vehicle collision occurred during late afternoon hours at the intersection of two urban trafficways. The north/south trafficway consists of three northbound travel lanes and one southbound travel lane. The east/west trafficway consists of two westbound travel lanes and one eastbound travel lane. The intersection is controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals.\n\n- **Weather Conditions:** The weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry.\n- **Road Conditions:** Both roadways are straight, with a speed limit of 60 km/h (37 mph) for the east/west lanes and 72 km/h (45 mph) for the north/south lanes. The southbound roadway has a slight uphill grade leading into the intersection, while the eastbound roadway has a slight downhill grade.\n\n**Vehicles and Drivers:**\n\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** The 2019 Ford F-150 pickup truck was being driven by a 38-year-old male driver (the primary case subject). The driver intended to continue traveling southbound through the intersection and into the northbound travel lane.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** The 2020 Honda Civic was being driven by a 25-year-old female driver. The driver intended to continue traveling westbound through the intersection and into the eastbound travel lane.\n\n**Collision Sequence:**\n\n1. **Event 1:** Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time. The frontal plane of V2 struck the right front quarter panel of V1 (Event 1). The impact caused V1 to veer to the right and into the northbound travel lane.\n2. **Event 2:** V1 struck a concrete median barrier with its right front quarter panel (Event 2). This impact caused the vehicle to yaw to the right and come to a stop on the east side of the median.\n3. **Event 3:** V2 continued to travel westbound and struck the east side of the concrete median barrier with its front end (Event 3). The vehicle was redirected to the east and came to rest in the northbound travel lane.\n\n**Aftermath:**\n\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** The 2019 Ford F-150 came to rest on the east side of the median. The driver was seriously injured and was extracted from the vehicle by emergency responders.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** The 2020 Honda Civic came to rest in the northbound travel lane. The driver of V2 sustained minor injuries and was taken to the hospital for evaluation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe primary cause of the collision was the simultaneous entry of both vehicles into the intersection without yielding the right-of-way. The male driver of V1 failed to yield the right-of-way to V2, which resulted in the collision. Both drivers are to blame for the collision, but the male driver of V1 is deemed primarily at fault due to the critical nature of the intersection entry and the resultant impact. The intersection signals were functional and did not malfunction during the incident.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.

The male driver sustained moderate injuries, while the female passenger sustained serious injuries when their small hatchback was involved in a head-on collision with a larger sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was also occupied by a 65-year-old, male rear-seat passenger who was not belted and sustained fatal injuries. Vehicle 2 was occupied by a 25-year-old, female driver who sustained incapacitating injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe crash occurred in the early morning on a dry road under clear skies. The roadway consisted of a two-lane, two-way, east/west, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 90 km/h (56 mph). The bituminous road was straight, on a 2% uphill grade, and had a crown ranging from 2 to 3% in the center of the road. There were no traffic controls in the area of interest.\n\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** A 2017 Toyota Corolla hatchback was traveling west in the right lane.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** A 2015 Honda Accord sedan was traveling east in the right lane and following behind a 2010 Toyota Camry sedan (V3).\n\nV2 attempted to pass V3 by crossing the center line and moving into the oncoming lane of travel. V1 and V2 collided head-on in an offset frontal configuration (Event 1). The impact pushed V1 back, and it began a clockwise rotation. V1's rear plane entered the eastbound lane of travel and was struck on the left rear corner by V3 (Event 2). V1 came to rest partially off the road on the eastbound shoulder, and V3 was towed due to damage. Meanwhile, the initial head-on impact also caused V2 to rotate clockwise and travel onto the westbound shoulder. V2 rolled left two quarter-turns (Event 3), coming to rest on its top in the westbound shoulder. V2 was towed due to damage.\n\n#### Investigative Findings:\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** The male driver sustained moderate injuries, primarily to the thoracic and lumbar spine. The frontal airbag deployed, which significantly mitigated the force of the impact.\n- **Right-Front Passenger of V1:** The female passenger sustained serious injuries, primarily to her pelvis and lower extremities. The frontal airbag deployed, but her injuries were exacerbated due to the lack of seatbelt restraint.\n- **Male Rear-Seat Passenger of V1:** The 65-year-old male passenger sustained fatal injuries. He was not belted, and the force of the collision caused him to strike the interior of the vehicle, resulting in intracranial hemorrhaging and fatal head trauma.\n- **Driver of V2:** The 25-year-old female driver sustained incapacitating injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The frontal airbag deployed, but the severity of the collision resulted in fatal head trauma. The vehicle was equipped with both frontal and side airbags.\n\n#### Contributing Factors:\n- **Improper Lane Usage:** V2's driver was attempting to pass V3 by crossing the center line, which is a high-risk maneuver.\n- **Speeding:** Both vehicles were traveling close to or above the posted speed limit, which increased the impact force during the collision.\n- **Lack of Seatbelt Restraint:** Both passengers of V1 were unbelted, which significantly contributed to the severity of their injuries.\n\n#### Recommendations:\n- **Enhanced Driver Education:** Emphasize the importance of proper lane usage and the risks associated with crossing center lines.\n- **Speed Limit Compliance:** Enforce speed limits on rural highways to ensure safer travel conditions.\n- **Seatbelt Use:** Implement measures to increase seatbelt usage in vehicles to protect passengers in the event of a collision.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the accident, including the contributing factors and the mechanisms of injury for all involved parties."

She sustained minor injuries when the compact sedan she was driving was involved in a head-on collision with a mid-size sedan. No other passengers were in the vehicle.\n\nThe crash occurred on a weekday afternoon at approximately 3:30 PM on a dry, clear day. The roadway consisted of a two-lane, two-way, urban highway with a posted speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph). The bituminous road was straight and on a level grade with no significant incline or decline. There were no traffic controls in the immediate area of the crash.\n\n**Vehicle and Occupant Information:**\n\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** 2018 Toyota Corolla compact sedan, driven by a belted 28-year-old, female driver. The driver was wearing a seat belt and the vehicle was equipped with a frontal airbag.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** 2014 Chevrolet Malibu mid-size sedan, driven by an unbelted 32-year-old, male driver. The vehicle was also equipped with frontal airbags and other standard safety features.\n\n**Sequence of Events:**\n\n1. **Pre-Collision Actions:** V1 was traveling east on the left lane of the highway. V2, driven by the male driver, was traveling west in the right lane. V2 was traveling within the speed limit. The male driver did not wear a seat belt, and he was not wearing a helmet (as this was an urban environment without potential for severe airborne impacts).\n\n2. **Collision (Event 1):** V1 and V2 collided head-on in a frontal configuration. The impact was symmetrical, with both vehicles experiencing significant deformation to their front ends.\n\n3. **Post-Impact Actions:** After the initial collision, both vehicles came to rest on the highway. V1’s front end was severely deformed, and the driver’s seat was pushed towards the rear of the vehicle. V2’s front end was similarly deformed, with the engine hood and bumper exhibiting extensive damage.\n\n4. **Effects on Occupants:**\n   - **Driver of V1:** The belted 28-year-old female driver sustained minor injuries, primarily to her neck and knee. The frontal airbag deployed, reducing the impact forces she experienced.\n   - **Driver of V2:** The unbelted 32-year-old male driver sustained serious injuries. The deployment of the frontal airbags did not prevent significant injuries, likely due to the lack of seat belt use.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe collision was a result of both drivers traveling within the posted speed limit, but the male driver’s failure to wear a seat belt significantly increased his risk of serious injury. The deployment of the frontal airbags for both drivers helped to mitigate the extent of their injuries, although the male driver’s failure to use his seat belt negated the full protective benefits of the airbags.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Safety Education:** Further emphasis on the importance of wearing seat belts, particularly in vehicles with airbags.\n2. **Road Safety Campaigns:** Continued public education campaigns focusing on the risks of head-on collisions and the importance of adhering to speed limits and traffic rules.\n3. **Vehicle Safety Features:** Ensuring that vehicles are equipped with advanced safety features and that these features are optimized for all occupants.\n\n---\n\nThis report provides a detailed analysis of the collision, including the sequence of events, the injuries sustained by the occupants, and recommendations for improving road safety."

The driver sustained moderate injuries and the passenger sustained minor injuries when their small sedan was involved in a head-on collision with a pickup truck.\n\n**Crash Overview:**\n\nThe crash occurred during the early afternoon on a dry, clear day. The roadway consisted of a two-lane, two-way, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph). The bituminous road was straight, on a 2% uphill grade in the direction of travel for Vehicle 1, and had a crown ranging from 2 to 3% in the center of the road.\n\n**Vehicle Information and Crash Sequence:**\n\n- **Vehicle 1 (V1):** A 2019 Toyota Corolla, a small sedan, driven by the 42-year-old female.\n- **Vehicle 2 (V2):** A 2015 Chevrolet Silverado, a pickup truck.\n\n**The Crash:**\n\nV1 was traveling east in the right lane, while V2 was traveling west in the left lane. V2 attempted to pass another vehicle by crossing the center line and moving into the oncoming lane of travel. V1 detected V2's movement and applied emergency braking but was unable to avoid the collision.\n\n**Collision Events:**\n\n- **Event 1 (Head-on Collision):** V1 and V2 collided head-on in an offset frontal configuration (Event 1). The impact caused V1 to push back and rotate clockwise. V2 also rotated clockwise and traveled onto the westbound shoulder. The initial head-on impact also pushed V1 back, causing it to strike a concrete median divider in the center of the road. V1 then came to rest partially off the road on the westbound shoulder, while V2 came to rest on the westbound shoulder.\n\n- **Event 2 (Secondary Impact):** Due to the pushback caused by the initial head-on collision, V1’s rear plane entered the eastbound lane of travel and was struck by a small sedan (V3), which was traveling eastbound in the left lane and had been following V1 at a safe distance (Event 2). V3 sustained minor damage and was able to continue in service.\n\n**Post-Collision Activities:**\n\n- Both vehicles involved in the head-on collision (V1 and V2) were towed due to significant damage.\n- The driver of V1, who was belted and had a deployed frontal airbag, sustained moderate injuries, primarily to her upper body and lower extremities.\n- The passenger of V1, also belted and with a deployed side airbag, sustained minor injuries to his lower extremities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe crash was primarily the result of V2 encroaching into V1’s lane of travel by crossing the center line. Both vehicles sustained significant damage due to the head-on collision and the secondary impact with V3. The deployed airbags provided some protection to the occupants, but the severity of the collision resulted in injuries to the driver and passenger of V1.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- Drivers should maintain a safe following distance and avoid crossing the center line, especially when attempting to pass other vehicles.\n- Vehicles should undergo regular maintenance to ensure proper handling and safety.\n- Drivers should always wear their seatbelts and ensure that passengers do so as well.\n\n**Incident Location:**\n\n- **Roadway:** Two-lane, two-way, rural highway\n- **Speed Limit:** 100 km/h (62 mph)\n- **Weather Conditions:** Dry, clear day\n\n**Witness Accounts and Evidence:**\n\n- Photos and video footage from the scene\n- Vehicle damage assessments\n- Eyewitness testimonies\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe investigation confirms that the head-on collision was a result of V2’s violation of the two-lane highway rules, leading to a significant accident with multiple impacts and resulting injuries. The deployment of airbags played a crucial role in mitigating the severity of the injuries sustained by the occupants."

The case also evaluated the injuries sustained by the 70-year-old male driver of V2, who was pronounced dead at the scene. There were no other passengers in either vehicle.\n\n**Incident Summary:**\nThe crash occurred at 4:30 PM on a Friday afternoon under clear skies and dry road conditions. The incident took place on a two-lane, two-way, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 112 km/h (70 mph). The bituminous road was straight, on a 1% downhill grade, and had a slight crown in the center.\n\nVehicle 1 (V1), a 2018 Toyota Camry, was traveling east. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2016 Ford F-150, was traveling west. V2 attempted to pass V1 on a curve but crossed the center line due to overcorrection. V1's driver immediately applied the brakes and attempted to steer to the right but was unable to avoid the collision.\n\n**Collision Sequence:**\n1. **Event 1:** V1 and V2 collided head-on in a frontal configuration. The impact was significant, causing both vehicles to rotate. V1 began a clockwise rotation, while V2 spun counterclockwise. Both vehicles came to rest in the center of the road.\n2. **Event 2:** The initial impact pushed V1 to the right, causing it to strike a tree on the roadside. V2 separated from the collision site and traveled back across the center line, coming to rest on the left side of the road.\n3. **Event 3:** V2 continued to spin and traveled on a rightward path, eventually coming to rest on its side in a small ditch on the left side of the road.\n\n**Vehicle and Occupant Data:**\n- **V1 (Toyota Camry):** \n  - Driver (female, 45 years old) was belted and sustained moderate injuries (fractures, contusions).\n  - V1 was equipped with dual front airbags, side curtain airbags, and a dashboard-mounted knee airbag.\n- **V2 (Ford F-150):**\n  - Driver (male, 70 years old) was not belted and sustained fatal injuries. The seatbelt remained unfastened.\n  - V2 was equipped with dual front airbags, side curtain airbags, and a dashboard-mounted knee airbag.\n  - All airbags in V2 deployed in the collision.\n\n**Road Conditions and Contributing Factors:**\n- The road was straight and dry, with no traffic controls in the vicinity.\n- The posted speed limit was observed by both drivers, but V2's attempt to pass and cross the center line contributed to the collision.\n- The weather was clear, and there were no external factors such as snow or ice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe head-on collision was primarily due to the overcorrection of V2's driver, who attempted to pass V1. The belted status of V1's driver mitigated the injuries sustained, while V2's unbelted driver's lack of restraint contributed to the fatal outcome. Both vehicles were towed due to significant damage.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Drivers should maintain safe distances and avoid attempting dangerous maneuvers such as passing on curves.\n- The importance of using seat belts is emphasized, especially in vehicles with advanced airbag systems."

The one-way westbound channelized roadway consists of two travel lanes for through traffic and one dedicated right turn lane at the intersection. Both roadways are straight, with a speed limit of 72 km/h (45 mph), and the intersection is controlled by overhead, standard electric, tri-colored traffic signals.\n\nAt the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. Vehicle 1, a 2019 Toyota Camry sedan, was being driven by the 42-year-old female driver (CIREN case subject) in the number two, southbound, travel lane approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of V1 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling south.\n\nVehicle 2, a 2019 Ford Escape small SUV, was traveling westbound in the far left lane, approaching the intersection from the east. The driver of V2 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling west.\n\nBoth vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of V2 struck the left plane of V1 (Event 1). Vehicle 1 yawed in a counterclockwise direction and impacted a concrete curb (Event 2) with its right rear wheel. This impact caused V1 to trip and undergo a right-side-leading four-quarter-turn rollover event (event 3). During the rollover event, V1 impacted a metal guardrail with its undercarriage (Event 4). Vehicle 1 came to rest on its top in the grassy area off the west edge of the roadway. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage.\n\nVehicle 2 rotated in a slight counterclockwise direction, coming to rest on the concrete median. The Ford Escape sustained significant damage and was also towed due to disabling damage.\n\n#### Emergency Response:\nEmergency services arrived on scene promptly, providing medical assistance to the 42-year-old female driver, who was transported to the nearest hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Both drivers were cooperative and provided statements.\n\n#### Contributing Factors:\n- Both vehicles were traveling at or near the posted speed limit.\n- The driver of Vehicle 2 did not yield to the oncoming traffic while intending to turn left.\n- The driver of Vehicle 1 was experiencing a medical event prior to the collision, which may have impaired her reaction time.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe collision was primarily the fault of the driver of Vehicle 2 due to failing to yield the right-of-way at the intersection. The driver of Vehicle 1 was also involved in the collision, but the medical event may have contributed to the severity of the accident. Further investigation into the medical event and potential medical-related factors will be conducted to understand the full scope of the incident.\n\n### Final Action:\nBoth vehicles were involved in a serious collision, and investigations are ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident and to prevent similar incidents in the future. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage, and the scene was cleared by the relevant authorities."

This impact caused the right side of the vehicle to be damaged, but did not immediately result in a rollover.\n\nFollowing the impact with the utility pole, the vehicle began to spin counterclockwise, striking a tree (Event 2) on the left side of the roadway. The impact with the tree caused the vehicle to lose additional control and start rolling over. The vehicle then rolled a total of three-quarters of a turn (Event 3), contacting the tree again during the rollover, before coming to rest on its right side in a grassy field (Event 4).\n\nThe driver was ejected from the vehicle during the rollover and was found unconscious on the ground. Emergency medical services were immediately dispatched, and the driver was transported to the hospital for treatment of serious injuries. The vehicle was severely damaged and required towing due to the extensive damage sustained in the crash.\n\n**Casualties:**\n- **Driver:** Serious injuries, unconscious upon impact, transported to the hospital.\n\n**Vehicle Damage:**\n- Front and right side extensively damaged from the initial impact with the utility pole.\n- Additional damage to the left side from the tree strike.\n- Severe damage to the roof and body as a result of the rollover.\n- The vehicle was completely overturned on its right side.\n\n**Post-Crash Actions:**\n- Emergency services were called immediately and arrived on scene within minutes.\n- The vehicle was towed to a nearby body shop due to the extent of the damage.\n- The driver was treated and observed at the hospital for several hours before being released.\n\n**Safety Implications:**\n- The accident highlights the importance of regular vehicle maintenance, particularly brake systems.\n- It also underscores the potential for significant injuries in rollover accidents and the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis single-vehicle rollover was the result of a brake failure, which caused the vehicle to lose control and subsequently roll over. The driver’s injuries and the severe damage to the vehicle serve as a stark reminder of the dangers associated with such incidents. Further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the brake failure."

The crash occurred during the late afternoon, under clear weather conditions, on a two-lane, residential, asphalt roadway. The road was dry and level, oriented east-west without traffic controls. The posted speed limit was 50 km/h (31 mph).\n\nVehicle 1 was being driven by a 42-year-old male driver who was attempting to make a right turn from a residential side street onto the main arterial road. The driver intended to proceed northbound on the arterial road.\n\nAt the time of the accident, the driver of Vehicle 1 was not using a turn signal and had begun the right turn maneuver. As the car turned onto the arterial road, it lost control and the front-end of Vehicle 1 struck a utility pole (Event 1) located on the right side of the road. The impact caused the pole to break the front windshield and the car to continue traveling in an eastward direction across the road.\n\nThe force of the impact and subsequent loss of control caused Vehicle 1 to spin 180 degrees before coming to rest in the westbound lane, facing west (Event 2). The vehicle sustained significant damage to the front end, including damage to the bumper, headlights, and front fenders. The driver sustained minor injuries and was taken to the hospital for evaluation.\n\nBoth drivers and witnesses stated that the road conditions were clear and dry with no other vehicles involved. The driver of Vehicle 1 was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. The vehicle was towed due to the extent of the damage and the injuries sustained by the driver.\n\n**Investigation Findings:**\n\n- The driver's failure to use a turn signal and begin the right turn maneuver in a clear zone contributed to the loss of control.\n- There were no mechanical issues with the vehicle that could have contributed to the accident.\n- The driver reported no prior medical issues that would have affected his ability to operate the vehicle safely. However, an initial medical evaluation was inconclusive regarding any potential pre-accident health issues that might have led to the loss of control.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe accident was determined to be primarily the result of the driver's failure to use proper turn signal procedures and a lack of control while making a turn. The driver of Vehicle 1 is advised to undergo a medical evaluation to rule out any potential health issues that might have contributed to the loss of control. The driver was also advised to ensure proper use of turn signals and to observe proper road turning techniques in the future."

The 28-year-old male driver, who was belted, was seriously injured in the crash. The incident occurred during the afternoon on a clear, sunny day on a two-lane, rural, asphalt roadway. The road was straight and level, with a slight downhill grade (3%) and posted speed limit of 60 km/h (37 mph). The dry conditions made the road surface conducive to quick response and efficient deceleration.\n\nVehicle 1 (V1) was being driven northbound by the male driver in the right lane of a two-lane, rural, asphalt roadway. The driver intended to continue driving northbound. At an intersection, the driver misjudged the distance to a light pole, which was located at the intersection. The pole had a 1.8-meter diameter and was made of reinforced concrete.\n\nThe driver attempted to make a right turn but misjudged the speed, causing V1 to travel off the right side of the road and impact the light pole (Event 1). The impact was significant, with the front of V1 striking the pole with its left side (Events 2 and 3). This caused the pole to break and the left front side of the vehicle to deform significantly. The impact also caused the vehicle to rotate slightly to the right (Event 4). Vehicle 1 then slid sideways on its right side and came to rest in a grassy area, facing slightly to the northeast (Event 5).\n\nBoth front wheels sustained damage from the impact (Events 6 and 7), and the windshield was cracked and deformed (Event 8). The vehicle was towed due to extensive damage. The driver, a 28-year-old male, was transported to the hospital with multiple injuries, including a fractured collarbone and a concussion, as a result of the impact.\n\nThe investigation indicated that the driver's misjudgment of the speed and distance to the light pole was the primary cause of the accident. Safety measures such as reducing speed and maintaining a proper distance from obstacles would have significantly mitigated the risk of such an accident.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe single-vehicle accident resulted in significant property damage to V1 and serious injuries to the driver. The accident serves as a reminder of the importance of safe driving practices and the need for adequate response to potential hazards on the road.\n\n---\n\nThis report outlines the details of a single-car accident, including the vehicle involved, the driver, the conditions, the sequence of events, and the outcome."

The posted speed limit was 88 km/h (55 mph) on a two-lane, two-way, east/west, rural highway. The bituminous road was straight and level with a slight 2% uphill grade in the eastbound direction. There were no traffic controls in the vicinity.\n\nA 2018 Honda Civic compact sedan (V1) was traveling east in the right lane at a reported speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). A 2016 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV (V2) was traveling west in the right lane at a reported speed of 75 km/h (47 mph). V2 was attempting to merge from the right lane into the left lane to pass another vehicle ahead, but it entered the oncoming lane too soon.\n\nV1 and V2 collided head-on in an offset frontal configuration (Event 1). The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and travel towards the left shoulder of the road. V2, after the initial collision, rolled left one and a half turns, coming to rest on its side in the westbound shoulder (Event 2). Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 came to rest partially off the road on the eastbound shoulder. V2 came to rest on the right (west) shoulder, in an unstable position.\n\nThe initial impact also caused V1 to travel further into the left shoulder, where its right front corner struck a tree (Event 3). V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to significant damage. The crash resulted in moderate injuries to the driver of V1 and serious injuries to the occupants of V2, who were not belted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe collision was primarily caused by V2 attempting to merge improperly and V1 traveling at a speed that may have contributed to the severity of the collision. Both vehicles' airbags deployed as part of the safety systems, which mitigated some of the injuries sustained by the occupants.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Drivers should adhere to posted speed limits and should not attempt to pass or change lanes in a manner that may cause a collision.\n- The implementation of improved traffic control measures, such as the use of signs or barriers, may help prevent similar incidents in the future.\n- Encouraging the use of seatbelts for all occupants could further reduce the severity of injuries in such collisions.\n\nFor further investigation and analysis, a detailed examination of the vehicles' black box data and witness statements will be required."

The driver sustained minor injuries, while the passenger suffered serious injuries when their 2017 Toyota Corolla was involved in a head-on collision with a 2007 Nissan Altima. There were no other passengers in either vehicle.\n\n#### Crash Details:\n- **Time and Weather Conditions:** The crash occurred at 3:30 PM on a clear, sunny day with dry road conditions.\n- **Roadway Information:** The crash took place on a two-lane, two-way, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 88 km/h (55 mph). The road was straight and level with no traffic controls or sharp turns in the vicinity.\n- **Vehicle Information:**\n  - **Vehicle 1 (V1):** 2017 Toyota Corolla, driven by the 45-year-old female (primary driver), traveling eastbound.\n  - **Vehicle 2 (V2):** 2007 Nissan Altima, driven by the 40-year-old male (driver), traveling westbound.\n\n#### Sequence of Events:\n1. **Initial Impact (Event 1):** V1 and V2 collided head-on in a frontal, center-to-center configuration. The impact pushed V1 back, causing it to rotate clockwise slightly.\n2. **Post-Impact Movements:**\n   - **V1:** After the initial impact, V1 continued to rotate and was pushed towards the left (west) shoulder of the road. V1's right side plane collided with the concrete barrier on the west shoulder (Event 2).\n   - **V2:** V2, after the initial impact, also began to rotate clockwise and was pushed towards the right (east) shoulder. V2 continued for a short distance on the shoulder before coming to rest.\n3. **Final Rest Positions:**\n   - **V1:** The vehicle came to rest partially off the road on the west shoulder, with its front end facing south.\n   - **V2:** The vehicle came to rest on the east shoulder, with its front end facing north.\n\n#### Injuries:\n- **Driver of V1:** Sustained minor injuries, primarily soft tissue contusions.\n- **Right-Front Passenger of V1:** Sustained serious injuries, including a fractured femur and severe lacerations. The passenger was pronounced with significant blood loss upon arrival at the hospital.\n\n#### Airbag Deployment:\n- **V1 (Driver):** Frontal airbag deployed successfully.\n- **V1 (Right-Front Passenger):** Frontal airbag deployed.\n- **V2 (Driver):** No airbags deployed.\n\n#### Contributing Factors:\n- **Speed:** Both drivers were likely traveling above the posted speed limit.\n- **Visibility:** Clear weather with good visibility, no contributing factors in this regard.\n- **Driver Actions:** The drivers did not have sufficient time to react to the other vehicle due to the head-on nature of the collision and the limited time between the initial impact and the post-impact movements.\n\n#### Conclusions:\nThe head-on collision was the primary cause of the injuries, with the severity exacerbated by the post-impact rotation and collision with the roadside barrier. The deployment of the airbags in V1 provided some protection for the driver, but the passenger's position and the impact with the concrete barrier led to more severe injuries."

The male driver sustained moderate injuries, while the female passenger sustained incapacitating injuries. The collision involved a 2010 Toyota Corolla (V1) and a 2012 Dodge Charger (V2). No other passengers were in either vehicle.\n\nThe crash occurred at midday on a dry road under clear skies. The roadway consisted of a two-lane, two-way, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 90 km/h (56 mph). The bituminous road was straight, on a 2% uphill grade in V1's westbound direction of travel, and had a crown ranging from 2 to 3% in the center of the road. There were no traffic controls in the area of interest.\n\nA 2010 Toyota Corolla (V1) was traveling west in the right lane. A 2012 Dodge Charger (V2) was traveling east in the right lane. V2 began to encroach slightly into V1's lane, likely due to a steering error. V1’s driver reacted by braking and steering slightly to the left to avoid collision.\n\nV1 and V2 collided head-on in an offset frontal configuration (Event 1). The initial impact caused V1 to rotate slightly clockwise and travel back into the eastbound lane. V1’s front left corner then collided with V2’s front right corner, causing V2 to rotate clockwise and travel off the westbound shoulder (Event 2). Both vehicles came to rest partially off the road on the eastbound shoulder. V1’s airbags deployed as designed, protecting the male driver and the female passenger, though the female sustained incapacitating injuries due to her position and the force of the impact. V2’s airbags did not deploy, possibly due to the design and deployment mechanisms of the vehicle.\n\nThe initial head-on impact also caused V2 to roll left one-quarter turn (Event 3), coming to rest in a partially inverted position on its left side in the westbound shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to extensive damage. The occupants were promptly removed from the vehicles and transported to the nearest hospital for treatment.\n\n#### Findings:\n1. **Primary Contributing Factors:**\n   - **Steering Error:** V2's driver made a steering error, encroaching into V1’s lane.\n   - **Braking and Steering Response:** V1's driver responded by braking and steering slightly to the left, but the timing and force of the response were not sufficient to prevent the collision.\n\n2. **Vehicle Dynamics:**\n   - Both vehicles were equipped with airbags, which deployed as designed to protect the occupants.\n   - The collision caused V2 to rotate and roll, highlighting the force and impact dynamics of a head-on collision.\n\n3. **Occupant Injuries:**\n   - **Male Driver (V1):** Sustained moderate injuries but was able to be safely extracted from the vehicle.\n   - **Female Passenger (V1):** Sustained incapacitating injuries, requiring immediate medical attention.\n\n4. **Roadway and Weather Conditions:**\n   - The road was dry and straight, with no traffic controls.\n   - Clear skies and midday conditions were present, eliminating visibility and weather-related hazards.\n\n#### Recommendations:\n1. **Driver Training:** Enhance driver training programs to emphasize the importance of maintaining lane discipline and responding appropriately to potential hazards.\n2. **Vehicle Safety Enhancements:** Consider enhanced airbag deployment mechanisms and occupant protection systems, particularly in vehicles that may not have optimal airbag deployment during frontal collisions.\n3. **Roadway Improvement:** Evaluate and improve signage and road markings to better delineate lane boundaries, especially in rural areas with no traffic controls.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe head-on collision resulted in severe injuries for the female passenger and moderate injuries for the male driver. Proper vehicle design, driver behavior, and roadway conditions contributed to the severity of the accident. Enhanced driver training and improved vehicle safety features are recommended to reduce the likelihood and impact of similar collisions."

The right side of Vehicle 1 collided with the left side of Vehicle 3 (the 2010 Nissan Altima) while it was stationary on the right shoulder (Event 4).\n4. **Event 4:** The impact caused Vehicle 1 to rotate clockwise and enter the number three eastbound travel lane, where the front plane of Vehicle 4 (2012 Ford Fusion, driven by an unknown male) struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 (Event 5). The impact caused Vehicle 1 to continue rotating clockwise.\n5. **Event 5:** Vehicle 1 spun out of control and came to rest facing east in the number four travel lane, the far right lane, where it collided with the rear plane of a 2006 Ford F-150 pickup truck that was stopped in the right shoulder (Event 6).\n6. **Event 6:** The collision with the 2006 Ford F-150 caused Vehicle 1 to skid across the right shoulder and come to a stop facing west in the number one travel lane. Vehicle 4, the Ford Fusion, continued to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, coming to rest facing north in the number two travel lane. Vehicle 3, the 2010 Nissan Altima, remained stationary on the right shoulder, as it was already parked there.\n7. **Event 7:** Due to the extensive damage, all vehicles were towed from the scene. Vehicle 1 also experienced a small fire contained to the engine compartment (Event 8).\n\n**Injuries:**\n\n- The driver of the 2015 Toyota Camry sustained severe injuries and was transported to the hospital.\n- The driver of the 2012 Ford Fusion sustained minor injuries and was treated on-site.\n- The driver of the 2010 Nissan Altima was not injured and remained in the vehicle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe multi-vehicle collision was the result of a series of unexpected events, including a sudden movement of a parked vehicle (Vehicle 2) and poor visibility due to the dark conditions. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was significantly impacted, causing extensive damage to all vehicles involved. Safety measures, such as proper vehicle positioning and drivers maintaining vigilant observation, could help prevent such accidents in the future."

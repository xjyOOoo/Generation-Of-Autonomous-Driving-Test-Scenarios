"crossroad","This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 30-year-old, male driver with deployed right curtain and left knee bolster airbags. He sustained critical injuries when the intermediate-size sedan he was driving was involved in a right plane, angled impact to the front of a medium/heavy truck. No other passengers were in the vehicle.The crash occurred during early evening hours on dark but lighted dry road under clear skies. The roadway consisted of a three-leg suburban intersection with no signal light controls. The two vehicles were traveling on the north/south roadway approaching the intersection from opposite directions. The posted speed limit was 56 km/h (35 mph). The bituminous asphalt road was curved left in V1’s northbound direction of approach with minimal superelevation or grade. V2’s southbound approach was straight with minimal grade.A 2013 Ford Focus sedan (V1) was traveling north in the middle lane of a three-lane road intending to make a left turn at the intersection. A decommissioned 1968 military cargo truck (V2) was traveling south in the right lane of a two-lane road intending to go straight through the intersection.V1 turned left across V2’s direction of travel. The right plane of V1 was struck by the front plane of V2 (Event 1). The front plane of V2 included a large bumper extension beyond the front axle, causing it to intrude through V1’s greenhouse area. V1 was then pushed southwest from impact by V2 into the southwest curb, striking it with its left wheels (Events 2 and 3). The two vehicles came to rest still in contact with each other in the southwest corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage."

"crossroad","This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 26-year-old male driver of a 2013 Nissan Sentra four-door sedan (Vehicle 1). Vehicle 1 was equipped with frontal airbags and seat backrest-mounted side airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions. Vehicle 1 was also equipped with curtain airbags for all outboard seating positions. None of the subject vehicle's airbags deployed as a result of a minor severity, oblique angled impact with a 2015 Toyota Corolla four-door sedan (Vehicle 2), nor the subsequent moderate severity rollover event.The crash occurred at an urban three-leg intersection between a major thoroughfare and residential street. The north/south trafficway consisted of four bituminous travel lanes which were divided by a large grass median and bordered by barrier curbing. The east/west roadway consisted of two bituminous travel lanes (level) which provided access to adjacent residences. In the immediate vicinity of the crash site, the southbound roadway crested at the intersection with the east/west residential street. To the south, the urban roadway transitioned into a downhill (i.e. negative) slope. Traffic control consisted of a stop sign for eastbound (turning) vehicles. The posted speed limit in the vicinity of the crash site was 56 kmph (35 mph) for all traffic. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions and the roads were dry.Vehicle 1 was initially southbound in the outboard travel lane on approach to the three-leg intersection and proceeding straight. Vehicle 2 was facing east on the residential street and attempting to turn right (south) onto the urban thoroughfare. As Vehicle 1 crested the hill, Vehicle 2 entered the intersection to proceed south, into the path of the southbound Nissan. Upon recognition of the impending harmful event, the driver of Vehicle 1 steered left in avoidance and partially entered the southbound inboard travel lane. The front-right area of Vehicle 1 impacted the front-left area of Vehicle 2 (Event 1). This initial impact resulted in minor damage to the case vehicle, and did not alter its pre-impact trajectory into the southbound inboard travel lane. At this point, the combination of steering inputs and negative post-impact slope of the road produced a roll moment as Vehicle 1's center of gravity was tipped outboard of its wheels. This initiated a two-quarter turn left side leading rollover resulting in moderate damage to the top of Vehicle 1 (Event 2). Vehicle 1 came to rest on its roof, straddling the center delineation line of the southbound roadway, facing west. Vehicle 2 came to rest in close proximity to the initial point of impact, in the southbound outboard lane, facing southwest."

Final rest was evidenced by a fluid stain located on the southwestern area of the southbound roadside. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage."
"face to face","This case focuses on the injury mechanisms of a belted 24-year-old male driver of a 2013 Nissan Cube four-door hatchback (V1), who was primarily involved in a severe, nine-o’clock near side impact with a wooden utility pole of unknown diameter. Vehicle 1 was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and right-front passenger positions, seat backrest-mounted side airbags for the front outboard seating positions, and roof rail-mounted curtain airbags for all outboard seating positions.This crash occurred during the post-midnight hours (dark, street lamps present) of a winter weekend day, at the right, curbed roadside edge of a two-lane north/south roadway. At the crash area, this bituminous roadway was level, but had a left-turning curve prior to straightening. The posted speed limit in the vicinity of the crash site was 48 kmph (30 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry.Vehicle 1, the 2013 Nissan Cube four-door hatchback, was being operated by the belted 24-year-old male case occupant in the southbound travel lane. The driver of V1 intended to negotiate the left-turning curve and continue traveling south.Vehicle 2, a 2004 Nissan Titan pickup truck, was parked, facing south, in a west roadside residential parking lot area, along a narrow curbed grass island bordering the north/south roadway.As V1 negotiated the left-turning curve, it drifted right and struck a slightly protruded area of the west roadside curb edge with its right front wheel/tire and right rear wheel/tire (Events 1 and 2). The driver of V1 is believed to have steered left and then over-steered right, experiencing a subsequent loss of control as V1 continued traveling southbound. Due to the loss of control, V1 subsequently departed/jumped the curbed west roadway edge again, at the curbed grass island bordering the west side of the roadway, in a left-side leading yaw/slide. At this time, V1’s left side plane struck the wooden utility pole (Event 3). Vehicle 1 is believed to have rotated counterclockwise as a result of this impact and subsequently struck the back plane (cargo bed area) of V2 with its back plane (Event 4) before coming to rest either at or on top of the cargo bed area of V2, leaning moderately toward the right (no rollover implied), and facing an easterly direction. As a result of the crash, all V1’s airbags deployed except for the right-front passenger frontal airbag."

Prior to this collision, the case vehicle sustained a far-side sideswipe collision with a 2001 Volvo S60.This four-vehicle collision occurred during the post-midnight hours (dark, street lights present) on a multi-lane urban interstate. This trafficway is composed of asphalt and has seven lanes that primarily travel in an east and west direction and are separated by a Jersey barrier. The eastbound lanes have a negative four percent grade and four travel lanes. The westbound roadway has three travel lanes. The roadway is straight with no traffic control devices. There is a posted speed limit of 113 km/h (70 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry.Vehicle 1, the 2012 Nissan Rogue, driven by the 41-year-old female driver (CIREN case subject), was traveling in the number two eastbound travel lane.Vehicle 2, a 2001 Volvo S60, was driven by an unknown age male in the number one, eastbound travel lane.Vehicle 3, a non-occupied 2012 Chevrolet Cruze was parked on the southern shoulder of the eastbound lane.Vehicle 4, a 2005 Ford Focus, driven by a 28-year-old female, was traveling eastbound in the number four travel lane.Vehicle 2 drifted to the right of the roadway and entered the south edge of the right shoulder. While on the shoulder, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 impacted the rear plane of Vehicle 3 (Event 1). This impact redirected Vehicle 2 back onto the roadway, where the left side of Vehicle 2 impacted the right side of Vehicle 1 (Events 2 and 3) in a sideswipe. This impact caused Vehicle 1 to enter into a counterclockwise rotation. Vehicle 1 exited lane two, crossed lane three and entered the number four travel lane into the path of vehicle 4 where the frontal plane of Vehicle 4 impacted the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 (Event 4). The impact caused Vehicle 4 to rotate in a counterclockwise direction where it impacted a Jersey barrier with the frontal plane (Event 6). Vehicle 4 continued to rotate in a counterclockwise direction coming to rest facing in a northeasterly direction on the north shoulder. Vehicle 1 rotated a short distance in a clockwise direction coming to rest facing northeast in the number three, eastbound travel lane. Vehicle 2 rotated in a clockwise direction and impacted the Jersey barrier with the rear plane (Event 5).

Its right side tires departed the roadway causing the right side plane of Vehicle 1 to swipe a concrete jersey barrier (Event 1) located on the right roadside. The driver reacted by steering left, sending the vehicle left across all travel lanes and into the median where it struck a concrete jersey barrier with its front (Event 2). This caused Vehicle 1 to rotate slightly counterclockwise and it rebounded rearward off of the concrete barrier. Vehicle 1 then rolled forward into the concrete barrier and contacted the concrete barrier a second time with its frontal plane (Event 3). Vehicle 1 came to rest at the concrete barrier, facing a westerly direction. "
"single car accident","This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted, 37-year-old, male driver with deployed frontal steering wheel-mounted airbag. He sustained serious injuries when the large pickup he was driving was involved in a frontal impact with a tree. No other passengers were in the vehicle.The crash occurred during daylight hours on a dry road under clear skies. The roadway consisted of a two-way, two-lane, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 89 km/h (55 mph). The bituminous road was straight (-3% downhill grade) and then transitioned to a left curve (-3% downhill grade). There were painted white lines marking the outer edge of the roadway and the north and south travel lanes were divided by double yellow lines. There were warning signs posted leading up to the left curve.A 2010 Ford F-150 (SuperCab) pickup (V1) was traveling north in the right lane. V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway and down an embankment before impacting a large tree with its front bumper where it came to final rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage."
"single car accident","This crash involves a 2014 Toyota Sienna minivan, modified for a mobility-impaired driver, that sustained a frontal impact to a fixed object. This single-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours, under clear conditions, on a five-lane industrial, asphalt roadway. The dry, level, five-lane road travels north/south without traffic controls with two lanes going northbound, two lanes going southbound, and a central turning lane. There is a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).Vehicle 1, a 2014 Toyota Sienna, was being driven northbound by the 63-year-old male driver in the left northbound travel lane. The driver of V1 intended to continue driving north.The driver of V1 reportedly coughed causing V1 to veer left, traveling across the center turning lane, across the two southbound travel lanes, and then struck a fixed object (concrete bridge wall) with the frontal plane. Vehicle 1 came to rest with the driver’s side door against the concrete bridge wall facing north. The vehicle was towed due to damage sustained in the crash."
"single car accident","This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 30-year-old, female driver with a deployed frontal airbag. She sustained severe injuries when the intermediate-sized coupe she was driving was involved in a multi-event crash to a utility pole and a large tree. No other passengers were in the vehicle.The crash occurred during the late evening hours in the dark on a dry road under clear skies. The roadway consisted of a two-way, east/west, two-lane, rural highway with a posted speed limit of 89 km/h (55 mph). The bituminous road was curved right with 5% superelevation and on a level grade at the beginning of the approach. There were no traffic controls in the area of interest.A 2003 Honda Accord coupe (V1) was traveling in the right lane when it crossed left across the center line and then departed the road to the left. V1 traveled a significant distance on the roadside before entering the tree line area.V1 struck a 20 cm diameter utility pole with its left plane (Event 1), engaging it in a sideswipe damage pattern. V1 continued into the tree line, striking a tree branch with its windshield (Event 2). V1 then struck a 36 cm diameter tree with its front plane (Event 3), coming to rest at impact with the tree. The utility pole and the tree sustained minor wood chips, but were otherwise undamaged. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage."
"single car accident","This crash involves a seriously injured, restrained, 45-year-old female driver of a 2015 Lexus ES-350 four-door sedan, which was primarily involved in left side collisions with two large trees.This single vehicle collision occurred during the nighttime hours (dark, unlit) on a curved two-lane roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one northbound lane and one southbound lane, with a 9 percent downhill grade and a right curve in the southbound direction. The speed limit is 72 km/h (45 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was rainy and the roadway and roadside surfaces were wet.Vehicle 1, the 2015 Lexus ES-350 sedan, was being driven by the 45-year-old female driver (CIREN case subject) in the southbound travel lane, attempting to negotiate a right-hand curve and continue traveling south.Vehicle 1 crossed the solid double yellow center line into the oncoming travel lane. The driver steered right and braked in an attempt to maneuver the vehicle back into the southbound travel lane. These maneuvers caused Vehicle 1 to lose traction and depart the roadway onto the left roadside in a slight clockwise yaw. Vehicle 1 traveled down an embankment where it contacted a 9 cm diameter tree with its left plane (Event 1). Vehicle 1 continued southeast and contacted a tree with a 6 cm diameter (Event 2) and a couple of small trees with diameters less than 3 cm (Event 3) with its left side. After impact with the small trees, Vehicle 1 contacted a large 60 cm diameter tree (Event 4) then a large 40 cm diameter tree (Event 5) with its left plane. After impact with the large trees, Vehicle 1 then contacted another group of trees with diameters no greater than 9 cm with its frontal plane (Event 6), then continued to travel southeast on the roadside and contacted a small group of trees with diameters no greater than 4 cm with its frontal plane (Event 7). After contacting the small group of trees, Vehicle 1 contacted a 6 cm diameter tree with its right plane (Event 8). After the right side impact, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and rolled further down the embankment where it contacted a 9 cm diameter tree (Event 9) with its frontal plane before coming to rest facing east. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.The driver, who was the only occupant of Vehicle 1, was noted as utilizing her three-point lap and shoulder belt (with retractor pretensioner). The vehicle was equipped with advanced frontal airbags, first and second row seat backrest-mounted hip/torso airbags, and roof rail-mounted curtain airbags. As a result of the impact, the driver's side first and second row seat backrest-mounted airbags and roof rail-mounted curtain airbags deployed. No additional airbags deployed. The driver exited the vehicle after the crash and was found wandering in the woods approximately 36 hours after the crash. She sustained serious injuries and was transported by land to a regional trauma center for treatment."

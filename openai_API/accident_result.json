        "query": "The crash configuration is about angle/sideswipe",
        "response": "This case involves an angle/sideswipe collision between two passenger cars at an intersection. The case vehicle (V1), a 2015 Toyota Camry sedan, was traveling west on a dry, level, two-lane asphalt road approaching a T-intersection with a stop sign. The roadway features a slight uphill grade for westbound vehicles approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2018 Honda Accord sedan, was traveling south on the intersecting two-lane asphalt road, which has no curbs and no traffic controls. It was daylight and clear at the time of the crash.\n\nAs the case vehicle was making a right turn at the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front right side of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in a sideswipe collision. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest on the southwest corner of the intersection, facing northwest. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to rest near the same corner, facing southeast. Both vehicles sustained damage and were towed from the scene.\n\nThe case occupant, the 36-year-old male driver of V1, was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt at the time of the crash. The driver benefited from the deployment of the frontal airbag and side curtain airbags. He sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene by emergency medical services. The driver of V2, a 45-year-old female, reported no injuries at the scene and declined medical transport. The driver of V2 was the sole occupant of the vehicle.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as the vehicle making a right turn at the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was attributed to a failure to yield the right of way. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 approaching due to glare from the sun. V2 was found to have been traveling within the speed limit and not at fault for the collision. The investigation concluded that the driver of V1 was at fault for failing to yield the right of way, resulting in the angle/sideswipe collision at the intersection."

        "response": "This case involves a near-side impact crash at an intersection involving a 2015 Toyota Camry and a 2017 Honda Accord. The crash occurred during daylight hours at a four-legged intersection with traffic signals controlling the flow of traffic. The intersecting streets are both two-lane, two-way asphalt roadways without curbs. The area where the crash occurred features an uphill grade for vehicles approaching the intersection from the southbound direction.\n\nVehicle 1 (V1), the 2015 Toyota Camry, was traveling east on the intersecting street, while Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2017 Honda Accord, was traveling north on the main road. Both vehicles entered the intersection when the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. This impact resulted in the deployment of V1's frontal airbags, left side impact airbags, and side curtain airbags. V1 rotated clockwise as V2 rotated counterclockwise, with both vehicles ultimately coming to rest in a southwesterly direction.\n\nV1 departed the southwest corner of the intersection and came to a final rest facing southeast. V2 came to a final rest near the same corner facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to the damage sustained in the crash.\n\nThe case occupant is the 35-year-old female driver of V1 who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver of V1 had the benefit of frontal, left side impact, and side curtain airbags deployment during the crash. She sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital where she was hospitalized overnight. The driver of V2 was reported to have sustained visible injuries, but her treatment status is unknown. There were no other occupants in either vehicle.\n\nThe Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as an impact on the left side of the vehicle, resulting in a near-side impact. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was attributed to the driver of V2 impacting the left side of V1 during the intersection maneuver. The driver of V1 reported no contributing factors to the crash. The driver of V2 left the scene without stopping, and therefore, no further information was obtained regarding her involvement in the crash."

        "query": "The crash configuration is about angle/sideswipe",
        "response": "This angle/sideswipe crash case involves an oblique, side-impact between two passenger cars at an intersection. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2015 Toyota Camry sedan, while the striking vehicle (V2) is a 2019 Honda Accord sedan. The driver of V1, a 35-year-old male, was restrained and sustained injuries in this collision.\n\nThe incident occurred during daylight hours at a T-intersection where the two-lane, asphalt road intersects with a secondary road. There are no traffic controls present at this intersection. V1 was traveling south on the main road approaching the intersection, while V2 was traveling west on the intersecting road. The weather was clear, and the road surfaces were dry.\n\nAs V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, V2, traveling westbound, struck the left side of V1 at an oblique angle. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, coming to rest facing southeast near the intersection. V2 continued west, crossed over into the opposing lane, and came to rest facing northwest on the westbound side of the intersecting road.\n\nThe driver of V1 was restrained by a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The vehicle was equipped with frontal airbags, side impact airbags, and side curtain airbags, which all deployed upon impact. The driver sustained injuries and was transported to a local hospital for treatment. The 35-year-old male driver of V1 was identified as the case occupant.\n\nBoth vehicles were towed from the scene due to the damage sustained in the collision. The driver of V2, the sole occupant of the vehicle, was reported to have sustained visible injuries, but her treatment status is currently unknown.\n\nThe investigation into this angle/sideswipe crash will continue to determine contributing factors and potential causes for the collision between V1 and V2 at the intersection."

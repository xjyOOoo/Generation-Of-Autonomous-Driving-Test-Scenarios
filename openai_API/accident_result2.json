The case occupant is the restrained driver of the Toyota Camry, who sustained injuries due to the angle/sideswipe collision.\n\nThe crash occurred during daylight hours at a T-intersection where the northbound two-lane asphalt road meets the eastbound two-lane asphalt road. The weather was clear, and the road surfaces were dry. The speed limit on both roads was 56 km/h (35 mph).\n\nVehicle 1, the 2012 Toyota Camry sedan, was traveling north on the two-lane road approaching the T-intersection. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue straight through the intersection.\n\nVehicle 2, the 2015 Honda Accord sedan, was traveling east on the intersecting road approaching the same intersection. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to make a left turn to head north.\n\nAs Vehicle 1 entered the intersection, it was struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle 2 in an angle/sideswipe manner. The impact caused Vehicle 1 to rotate counterclockwise until it came to rest on the east side of the intersection, facing northwest. Vehicle 2 continued eastbound after the collision and came to a stop on the eastbound lane, facing east.\n\nThe driver of Vehicle 1, a 35-year-old male, was restrained by the three-point lap and shoulder belt. The driver's frontal airbag deployed upon impact. The driver sustained injuries and was transported to a local hospital for treatment. The driver of Vehicle 2, a 40-year-old female, sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene.\n\nBoth vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The driver of Vehicle 1 was enrolled as the case occupant in this angle/sideswipe collision."

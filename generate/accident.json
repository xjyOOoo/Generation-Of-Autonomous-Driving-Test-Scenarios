The incident took place during daylight hours on a rural two-lane roadway approaching a three-legged intersection. \n\nThe first vehicle involved was a 2014 Honda Civic two-door coupe, driven by an unrestrained 21-year-old female. The second vehicle was a 2012 Chevrolet Cruze four-door sedan, which was stopped in the northbound lane waiting to turn westbound onto the intersecting road. \n\nAs the driver of the Honda Civic attempted to avoid colliding with the stationary Chevrolet Cruze, she steered left and braked but ultimately collided with its rear end. This initial impact caused her vehicle to enter into the southbound lane where it then collided head-on with a 2012 Honda Civic traveling in that direction.\n\nBoth vehicles sustained significant damage and had to be towed from the scene. The driver of the Honda Civic suffered moderate injuries as a result of this multi-vehicle collision.\n\nWeather conditions were cloudy at the time of the crash, and both roadways were dry with speed limits posted at 89 kmph (55 mph). There were no traffic controls present on either roadway leading up to the intersection where this accident occurred.\n\nOverall, this rear-end collision resulted in multiple impacts and serious injuries to one individual involved in this unfortunate chain of events."

The crash involved a moderately-injured, unrestrained, 21-year-old female driver of a 2014 Honda Civic two-door coupe, which rear-ended a 2012 Chevrolet Cruze four-door sedan. Following the initial impact, the frontal plane of the Honda Civic collided with the front of a 2012 Honda Civic two-door coupe.\n\nThe weather at the time of the accident was cloudy, and the asphalt roadway was dry with a speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). There were no traffic controls on the north/south roadway where the collision took place. Vehicle 1 (Honda Civic) was traveling in the left northbound travel lane while Vehicle 2 (Chevrolet Cruze) was stopped in that same lane waiting to head west onto an intersecting road. Meanwhile, Vehicle 3 (Honda Civic) was traveling southbound in its designated lane.\n\nThe driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to avoid hitting Vehicle 2 by steering left and braking but ended up colliding with its rear end before veering into oncoming traffic and striking Vehicle 3's frontal plane. Both Vehicles 1 and Vehicles were towed from scene due to disabling damage.\n\nThis accident report highlights how failure to maintain safe following distances can lead to chain reaction collisions resulting in injuries and significant vehicle damage. It serves as an important reminder for drivers to stay vigilant on roads at all times to prevent such incidents from occurring again."
